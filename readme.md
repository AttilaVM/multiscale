# multiscale #

A PythonMagick based module and CLI tool to scale all images from one source directory to multiple sizes, separated into different sub-directories. The new sizes are calculated from the given list of display resolutions and ratio.: display_resolution * ratio

The must common display resolutions are used by default.

I wrote this script to help out my daily workflow. So new features will be added on demand, however if you have a good idea to implement, do not hesitate to make a fork request or issue.

## TODO ##
- [ ] Make code asynchronous
